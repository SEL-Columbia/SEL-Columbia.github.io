Success in an infrastructure project depends as much on local support and participation as it does on coordination between politicians, financiers and utilities ([Tufte and Mefalopulos 2009][1]). We wanted to create a freely accessible tool for non-technical people to experience the infrastructure planning process and see the impact of different decisions on the community. By experimenting first-hand with web-based software, a user can understand on a map how changes in population, pricing and fiscal policy influence where infrastructure is built, who will get access and why different technologies such as off-grid solar, mini-grid diesel or bio-diesel and grid affect cost. 

Our lab combined technical expertise from remote sensing, operations research and electrical engineering into an easy-to-use system so that local leaders, politicians, financiers and utility owners can focus on communicating visually and negotiating between different electrification scenarios. 

  * Local leaders: Will the construction affect my community?
  * Politicians: How many businesses and households in my district will get access?
  * Financiers: What are the risk and return on investment?
  * Utility owners: Is it technically and financially feasible?

**Where do people live?**  The remote sensing component finds where people live using image recognition on satellite imagery. 

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-788" title="Result from scanning our building detector over farmland in Koraro, Ethiopia where red points mark computer guesses and white points mark human guesses" alt="Result from scanning our building detector over farmland in Koraro, Ethiopia where red points mark computer guesses and white points mark human guesses" src="/assets/uploads/blog/2013/06/20100220-HowPythonIsGuidingInfrastructureConstructionInAfrica_img_49.jpg" width="646" height="618" />][3] 

Results from the remote sensing component provide a spatial census, enabling us to estimate population density and spread with reasonable accuracy. Different settlement patterns hint at different electrification strategies: sparsely distributed clusters as in Ghana or Mali are good candidates for off-grid technologies such as solar, while larger clusters as in Tanzania justify diesel mini-grids and densely packed Kenya find grid electrification to be cost-effective ([Zvoleff, Kocaman, Huh, Modi 2009][4]). [<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-782" title="Settlement patterns differ greatly by location, resulting in different electrification strategies for off-grid solar systems, mini-grid diesel systems or grid distribution systems." alt="Settlement patterns differ greatly by location, resulting in different electrification strategies for off-grid solar systems, mini-grid diesel systems or grid distribution systems." src="/assets/uploads/blog/2013/06/settlement-patterns-1024x768.png" width="614" height="461" />][5] 

The command-line software to perform remote sensing was completed in 2008. We are in the process of optimizing the software to run on [graphical processing units][6] (GPUs) to make the system accessible via web. 

**How can we provide access to electricity?**  The econometric and operations research component uses demographics and pricing models to project electricity demand, cost and placement (

[Parshall, Pillai, Mohan, Sanoh, Modi 2009][7]). Users can freely explore what-if scenarios by changing the many parameters and see on a map what technology makes sense for each community, where and how much it will cost. 

We have created a web-based prototype of the infrastructure planning component that is being used this semester by students of the [Master&#8217;s in Development Practice][8] program at Columbia University. We are currently improving the map-based user interface and you will be able to use it through your browser soon. [2013 update: [ Network Planner ][9] is live and functioning in browsers.] 

**The power of open source software**  Both systems are built entirely using open source components such as 

[Python][10], [GDAL][11], [GEOS][12], [Lush][13], [OpenLayers ][14]and [AMQP][15]. </p>
