<p>
In 2017 The Sustainable Engineering Lab had its official relaunch as the The Quadracci Sustainable Engineering Laboratory. The name change followed a generous supporting donation from the Quadracci family and <a href="https://www.windhoverfoundation.org/">The Windhover Foundation</a>.
</p>

<p>
The launch was a happy occasion in The Northwest Corner Building at Columbia University.

Afterwards there was an opportunity to tour the lab and show some of our active projects.
