To bring the spirit of Modi Research Group projects to accessible classroom exercises, the group has created a collection of assignments in the MathWorks program, MATLAB. These assignments follow the course of the group&#8217;s wind and hydropower research, and include simulations for several locations across the United States.Â By packaging together the prompt, data, code, and solutions for these problems, we intend to prove that data-based learning is not only beneficial for university students, but also easy to assign and distribute. The first set of assignments will be posted soon!
