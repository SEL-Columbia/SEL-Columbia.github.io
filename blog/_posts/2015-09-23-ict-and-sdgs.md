[The Sustainable Engineering Lab (SEL)](/) collaborated with The Earth Institute and Ericsson in preparing a [report](http://unsdsn.org/ict-report) highlighting the revolutionary role of ICT as an enabler and accelerator to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For example, ICT is enabling new business models in [energy access](/shared-solar/), [agriculture](/smart-solar-irrigation/) and access to rich [data for development planning](/scale-up-initiative/). The press Conference with Hans Vestberg and Jeffrey Sachs was held as part of the [International Conference on Sustainable Development](http://ic-sd.org/). The SDGs represent a complex, global-scale problem-solving exercise, and the SEL is applying technologies in different ways to achieve these aggressive, yet attainable goals.
