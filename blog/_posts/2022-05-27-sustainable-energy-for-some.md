Last week I visited the slums of Kampala, Uganda while on my way to the Sustainable Energy for All Forum in Kigali. I wanted to see with my own eyes the conditions in the slums when it comes to energy and water. It is well known the world over that while grinding poverty is hard enough, having to pay exorbitant prices for services and consumables makes it a lot worse. It could be a choice between buying milk or paying for light. Primary education or charcoal. I found the residents of these slums paying prices for electricity, cooking fuels, and water that were several multiples of what they should be, while the quality of service was worse than that enjoyed by the middle or upper class few hundred meters away. Yet given the high population densities in slums, and proximity to existing public utilities, the cost of provisioning services for the poor should be much lower than that for those with higher incomes or those in rural settings. 

Dr. Pasquine Ogunsanya who runs a health clinic serving the most vulnerable, took me around to interview some of the residents living in a slum by the sides of a railway track, a stone’s throw from Alive Medical, a clinic she runs in Namuwongo. The residents in the Namuwongo slum make their home in unplanned semi- permanent houses made of scraps, straw, and mud without toilets. These have been put up by those who saw a profitable enterprise in investing in a shack that can pay back in rent in just a few years- building on land that they do not own. Without sanitation and good drainage systems, many residents without toilets pollute the trenches or surrounding areas since one must pay to use the community toilets. Heavy rains come with flooding worsening their living conditions.  

I talked to the few families we visited with my own narrow lens of the cost, quality, and reliability of services such as lighting, water, cooking, cost of credit, topics that I study. But it was hard not to miss the larger backdrop of precarious livelihoods, poverty, poor health, and vicious cycle of debt from COVID-19, with families raising a new generation without decent education, amidst increasing sexual and gender-based violence during the most formative years of life. Unfortunately, these are conditions are not unique to Namuwongo. Nearly half of Kampala lives in slum dwellings. 

It was common to see families- during my daytime visit I primarily saw women and children at home. A 60 sqft (6 sq meters) of space without a kitchen, a sink, a bathroom, or a water tap rents for $20/month, without the right to complain. A dangerously leaning mud-straw wall wall or a tin roof with holes. It is on take it or leave it terms. Per sqft the rent is only slightly lower, perhaps half that of a rental unit in Kampala that is solidly built and connected to services. 

At the time of my visit the only light in the otherwise dark windowless space came through those holes. A ceiling-mounted lightbulb and a mobile phone were the only electrical appliances visible. For this electricity they paid a flat monthly charge of $3.25. The landlord who supplies this electricity is also making a killing charging what works to be about $1 per unit, about 5 times what the Uganda utility or I in New York would pay per unit. What is ironic is that Uganda currently has excess electricity supply. Only about 60% of the contracted supply is being utilized. And the country is paying for that unused excess supply. The technical jargon for this unused but paid for portion is deemed energy.

The slum dwellers pay roughly $5 a month to obtain drinking water, which is purchased from middlemen. This is for two to three 20-liter plastic containers jerrycans that the residents bring to the location controlled by someone who in turns obtains that water from a city tap. For every 1000 liters or 275 gallons (my family consumes that much in a day, they do it in 20 days) it is nearly two times the cost of safe and pure home delivered water in New York City. It is 20 to 30 times what the utility in my parent’s hometown in India charges where costs of labor, distribution and water quality might be similar. Costs to produce electricity or procure nature gas have common reference points across the globe given their sources are internationally traded. The cost of physical volumes of supply of water are low in countries blessed with plenty of water and much of water pricing in the global north is for the cost of treating and disposing wastewater, a provision that is missing for the residents. 

They rely almost exclusively on charcoal for cooking fuel supplemented by scraps of scavenged wood, such as from discarded wooden furniture, doors, scaffolding etc. They pay roughly $15/month for about 30 kg of charcoal an absurdly high energy burden (what you pay for energy as a fraction of your income) given their income levels- but they have no other alternatives. The health and environmental externalities aside, if one adjusts for the lower efficiency of their stove compared to a gas stove, they pay about three times per MMBtu (a measure of how much heat a fuel can deliver when burnt) of cooking energy compared to those in my hometown in Western India, where piped gas is delivered to every home, supplied by a private operator that in turn obtains commercially-priced imported liquefied natural gas. There might be other cost-effective approaches as well, perhaps electric cooking using the surplus power that Uganda has. I saw numerous electric cooking appliances targeted for the poor on display at the Kigali conference.  

Economists have argued that slums are where one migrates to, to escape rural poverty for economic opportunities that cities offer. Indeed, the residents are there by choice. But that does not mean their living conditions should not be improved. There are debates as to whether improving infrastructure and services will lead to landlords charging higher rents, thus displacing the poorer tenants. Landlords don’t invest in infrastructure or improving the housing- they are already engaged in a profitable enterprise, both in housing and electricity service provision. Why should they invest in a property on land they don’t have a formal title to and might not be able to monetize those investments? Governments or in this case the railways are reluctant to provide formal title as that would be condoning illegal occupation. Utilities don’t want to provide services to someone without a formal rental contract, let alone a decent wall to mount an electric meter. There is now a wealth of experience from the east Africa region as to how to address these issues.  

My narrower engineering perspective is that energy, water, and sanitation provision, are public services and hence governments need to forcefully intervene. They do so for other city and rural populations. It is not satisfactory to ask the poor to organize themselves in co-operatives, come up with their own community-based approaches, make do with only decentralized options, rainwater harvesting or solar lanterns or locally produced briquettes- when those advocating these are themselves served by publicly provided infrastructure without obvious cost recovery. The East Africa region has massive (compared to their own anticipated consumption for years to come) fossil fuel resources, both liquids and gas. Pipelines for oil (from Uganda to coast through Tanzania) and the other way for gas will start to be built shortly. Contracts are being awarded as we write this. If all goes well, government budgets, fuel and financing will not be in short supply.  Even today, financial outlays are not a constraint, as operational costs can be recovered from the residents while saving them money if publicly managed provisioning of services is done at scale for all.

It is absurdly expensive to be poor. Yet given how small a space you occupy, your low consumption level, proximity to infrastructure- the cost of providing these same services is a small fraction of what it takes to serve the urban middle class or the rural poor- constituencies that have ensured a political voice for themselves. Living informally in a settlement by the railroad track means you are to be forgotten, hidden, without a political voice. In some countries you could be forced to relocate to just make the city look clean and pretty. When former President Trump visited my hometown in India, walls were quickly put up by the local government along the road POTUS would travel so that that the slum dwellers would not be seen by him or his entourage. And this was when he was on the way to visit Gandhi Ashram, where Gandhi lived with the outcasts of society, to give them dignity and visibility. 

At the same time there was no way for me to express any emotion to those I met, who is spite of their most desperate conditions had hope in their eyes and were trying to look ahead.  The tears had to wait until I came back to a luxury hotel few minutes by car.  Kampala the capital of Uganda, located on rolling hills, by Lake Victoria- the source of the Nile, is one of the most beautiful cities I have ever visited. On the morning of my visit, an intense thunderous tropical downpour had given way to a sharp clear sun on the expansive landscape. Surrounded by lush greenery and giant trees, blessed with rain and the sun, blessed with water and the most fertile soil- it was hard to imagine why hundreds of thousands are struggling without the most basic access to food, fuel, water, sanitation, and light. Sustainable energy for some remains a dream.
