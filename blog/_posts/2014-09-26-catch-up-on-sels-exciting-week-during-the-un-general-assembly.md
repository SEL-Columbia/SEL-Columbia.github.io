This past week has been a busy and engaging week for the members of SEL, especially our Director, Professor Vijay Modi. Modi participated in Climate Summit events, *Implementing Sustainable Energy For All* and policy session, *SE4ALL Global Energy Efficiency Accelerator Platform*

Lastly, in support of our work in Nigeria and to highlight the launch of [NMIS][5], members of the SEL team attended the *National Perspective in Localising the Post 2015 Agenda: Lessons from the Inter-Governmental Partnership in the Implementation* of the MDGs hosted by the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on the Millennium Development Goals, Nigeria.

The events created further discussion in the lab and we’re eager to continue our work researching and engineering innovative ways to help achieve sustainable international development.
