On March 6, a third workshop was held in relation to the preparatory studies of planning that lead to the country national electrification plan with universal coverage goal. Within this activity, supported by Columbia University's Sustainable Engineering Laboratory (SEL), two previous workshops have been carried out to identify and collect existing information in the country and also to know the gaps in order to be able to do this Geospatial planning exercise.

During the workshop, the demonstrator pilot results were presented for the province of Pastaza to show the scope of the tool and make necessary adjustments for later stages. The workshop was attended by IDB Representative in Ecuador, Mr. Morgan Doyle, representatives of the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy (MEER) and several electricity utilities and other government organizations.
