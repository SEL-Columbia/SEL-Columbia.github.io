<p>
Our lab has been busy over the last year. If you're new to some of our projects
or just want an overview, here are a few introductions:
</p>

<br>

# Acacia Irrigation

<p>
Acacia Irrigation is an off grid battery-less solar pumping system. Our lab
currently has three working systems in Gabar, Senegal. The systems serve 21
farmers providing clean accessible energy for a fraction of the cost of
comparable systems.

# Dokomo Forms

<p>
Dokomo Forms is an offline-capable mobile data collection tool. Dokomo Forms
allows anyone to deploy a survey effort that leverages the flexibility and
capability of mobile phones while remaining fully functional offline. If you
used Formhub, this is the newest iteration from our lab.

# Electrification Planning

<p>
qSEL has more than ten years of field work and project implementation experience
in the areas of development planning and geo-spatial data gathering in many
countries in Africa, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific, Latin America, and the
Caribbean (LAC). The qSEL team provides training in many technical aspects of
geo-spatial data gathering and management, including grid and social
infrastructure mapping, and algorithmic modeling.

# NMIS

<p>
Nigeria's MDG Information System helped to map 34,000 health facilities, 98,000
education facilities, and 132,000 water facilities in Nigeria! It is a massive
tool for development.

# Quench

<p>
Quench offers an improved water management solution that can increase access and
provide more reliable service at public or private tap stands. Our lab has new
prototypes and is preparing to field test them in the coming months.

# Shared Solar

<p>
Shared Solar is a Pay-As-You-Go minigrid for rural electrification. It helps
connect the last mile customer enabling growth for the smallest consumer. Our
installed minigrids support businesses and schools beyond the reliable grid.
