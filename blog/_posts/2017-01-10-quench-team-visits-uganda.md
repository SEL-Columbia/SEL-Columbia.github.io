Our Quench team visited Uganda to gain new perspective on the project.

The team traveled around southern Uganda touring different water facilities and existing tap stands in Mbarara, Karamoja, and Ruhiira.

This trip spawned new ideas and a fresh outlook on the project. Once back in the states new test installations were completed. Demos can be seen at the links below.
