Building on insights from the [CEET policy brief](https://files.unsdsn.org/20231215%20CEET%20Brief%20Beyond%20Basic%20Electricity%20(1).pdf) "Beyond Basic Electricity Access: The Unrealized Promise of Solar Power for Economic Growth in Africa", key findings from our recent brief explore how a strategic mix of grid extensions, mini-grids, and solar home systems (SHS) when integrated effectively, can serve diverse populations while catalyzing economic development. Read the brief [here](/assets/uploads/blog/2025/M-300/CEET_M300_Brief_Jan_2025.pdf).
