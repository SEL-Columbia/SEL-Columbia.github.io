title: Symposium on Sustainable and Affordable Energy Challenge for the World

The last few years have brought global energy issues to the fore.  At the recently concluded **COP21** in 2015, it became clear that both developing and developed countries will need to accelerate deployments of renewable energy. This puts many developing countries in a technologically and financially challenging position where they want to rapidly accelerate deployment of renewables while also addressing the energy access and growth imperatives.  India is a classic case, with a goal to deploy 160 GW of solar and wind by 2020, when last yearâ€™s average power consumption was 120GW. At the same time 20% of Indians have no electricity access. 


## Event Details


**2016 THEME**

_**Sustainable and Affordable Energy Challenge for the World.**_

**Sunday May 8, 2016**

**9am to 3.30 pm**

Davis Auditorium in Schapiro Hall, Columbia University

(see Directions at end) 

**2016 event jointly sponsored by**

Department of Mechanical Engineering, SEAS, Columbia University

IIT Bombay Heritage Foundation and Alumni Association of Greater New York



This one-day symposium will address the issues of integrating high fractions of variable power into the grid.  What are the novel ideas for edge-of-the-grid systems, demand side management, smart meters, and new ways to manage variable sources on the grid, that can take advantage of a growing economy that is willing to tolerate less than perfect reliability and lack of legacy players?

 

We will also learn of the challenges and opportunities of rethinking the power system, in a state like New York that is leading the way through the REV initiative.
