The newest members of the Sustainable Engineering Lab are software engineers Denis Papathanasiou and Chris Tan. <!--more-->Denis began his career working on infrastructure projects in Asia. After a stint on Wall Street, he rediscovered software programming, although he still doesn&#8217;t know what he doesn&#8217;t know.

Raised in New Brunswick, Canada, Chris received his bachelors degree in Biochemistry at University of New Brunswick and honed his self-taught coding skills at isoHunt. When not in the SEL&#8217;s software engineer hangout, the Engine Room, Chris can be found rock climbing and playing Ultimate Frisbee and League of Legends.
