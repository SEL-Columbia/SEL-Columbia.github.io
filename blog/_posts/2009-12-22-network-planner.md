The current infrastructure planning and implementation framework has often been inefficient in consolidating expertise and resources for more equitable and rapid scale up of access to services.  In response, we are developing a platform that is able to provide decision makers – utilities, planners, governments, communities – with the tools to make rapid data-driven assessments on how to roll out infrastructure at various administrative levels (national, district, and community).

Our platform uses geo-spatial,  financial, demographic, energy demand, technology costing (costs related generating and distributing electricity) information and modified minimum spanning tree algorithms to rapidly visualize and evaluate the feasibility,as well as, estimate the investment needed to scale-up electricity distribution. The &#8220;Network Planner&#8221; team is working on a web-based, user-friendly decision support platform for infrastructure planning, building upon methodology and tools previously developed by alumni of our research group.There is also an ongoing effort to research and develop algorithms and models to improve the platform.
