  Work at the Sustainable Engineering Lab
</h2>

<p style="color: #000000;">
  We solve real-world problems in the developing world; we build software to make the development process smarter and to bring new services, like health and energy, to people that need them most. We primarily focus our efforts in Africa, India and Haiti.
</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">
  The problems we tackle are often related to data and data flow; the tools we build incorporate geospatial planning, open-data web services, operational optimization algorithms, mobile phone-based data collection, data dashboards and the like. We use python, R, go, mongodb, nodejs/javascript, but above all, we&#8217;re looking for people who are passionate about software engineering in a development context.

  ICT development coordinator
</h1>

<p style="color: #000000;">
  The Earth Institute is carrying out a study of some of the successes of ICT approaches in the context of Development (as in all aspects of development in poorer countries).  The goal is not so much a macroeconomic study, but of good examples/practices. We hope to document where ICT tools were &#8220;adopted&#8221; by local field teams in the Africa work we have done. Much of this work will be literature review and then some lessons from talking to different groups in The Earth Institute.
</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">
  The report is mainly targeted at the upcoming UN General Assembly meetings and also can be independently published.  We have already some commitment of help from two Masters Student Interns with background in developing countries and telecom. A separate empirical economist for the macro-level work is also going to be on board, but we are looking more specifically for a person who can synthesize field experience and good practice across different sectors such as health, education, agriculture, water, energy, transport, business development, local participatory processes/government and private sector.
</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">
  The project is expected to last roughly 6 to 8 months at a minimum but a longer term assignment of a year is certainly possible.
