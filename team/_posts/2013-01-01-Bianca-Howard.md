Bianca Howard is currently a Ph.D. Candidate in mechanical engineering in the Energy, Infrastructure, and Development Lab of Professor Vijay Modi at Columbia University. She is also a trainee in the National Science Foundation IGERT “Solving Urbanization Challenges Through Design”.  Her research interests are in urban energy planning with emphasis on maximizing the reduction of primary energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in an urban environment by incorporating various distributed generation technologies. Her most recent work has developed an online map (http:// modi.mech.columbia.edu/nycenergy/) displaying an estimate of the annual building energy consumption of New York City for each tax lot.  Ms. Howard received her Bachelor’s of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Nebraska in 2009 and her Master’s of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Columbia University in 2011.
