      SharedSolar is a modular micro-grid solution that provides electric infrastructure and service to a cluster of customers that are not immediately considered viable for grid connectivity. Using a pay-as-you-go model, smart metering and flexibility for supply, load and tariff management, SharedSolar provides reliable electricity, achieving maximum financial and social inclusion. Customers pre-pay for the service anytime, in amounts of their choosing, with no monthly fees. Real-time demand and supply management strategies help ensure fair distribution and high uptimes. In addition, the generation and storage capacities are sized to match existing demand, as it grows over time, capacity can be added through additional solar panels or even other local energy sources. When the grid arrives, the local distribution network and management system can be utilized without modifications. All stakeholders have access to real-time, contextual information and customers can access their use and balance data. Operators have enhanced situational awareness and control, allowing them to manage their assets and operations effectively, while donors and governmental agencies can monitor performance using the same platforms.

    <h3>
      How it works
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Field Agents</strong><br />Field Agents purchase wholesale energy credits from the SharedSolar Franchisee, which are stored on their devices for distribution in their service area.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Customers</strong><br />Customers make payments to Agents, who then apply the energy credits to their accounts.

    <h3>
      Benefits
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      <strong>User Convenience</strong> <br /> SharedSolar helps create a grid-like (230V AC) connection for even the poorest, giving them the ability to flexibly use electrical lighting, cell-phone charging, tablet/television, refrigeration, small pumps and other appliances even at low consumption levels. With smart metering small appliance finance and small irregular payments are accommodated without high transactions costs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Social and Environmental</strong> <br /> Health and safety problems from toxic fumes and poor quality lighting are eliminated. Clinics, schools, community centers and drinking water systems can all receive reliable power without burdening themselves with maintenance of separate stand-alone systems. Tariff-enabled financing permits leasing-to-own models for efficient appliances without the additional costs of micro-finance transactions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <p />
      
      <p>
        <strong>Economic &#038; Employment</strong> <br /> Income-generating activities like agriculture, entertainment, ice-making, tourism etc can be powered sustainably. Systems can be upgraded when demand grows, ensuring precious capital is used judiciously while at the same time allowing customers and local entrepreneurs to grow their demands as they need without having to upgrade their individual systems.
