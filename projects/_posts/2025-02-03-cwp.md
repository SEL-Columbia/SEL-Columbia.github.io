summary: "More than 800 million people worldwide, many of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa, do not have access to electricity. Achieving access to it is critical for expanding economic opportunity, ensuring food security and reaching other key measures of human development. Research and investments tend to focus on improving energy access in homes, schools and health facilities, with less emphasis on providing energy access for income-generating activities, such as farming and small businesses. Through partnership and innovative data collection and analysis, the project aims to unlock economic opportunities across sub-Saharan Africa and beyond."
