Liberia has one of the lowest electrification rates in the world. The countryâ€™s Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy (MLME), power company (LEC), and Rural and Renewable Energy Agency (RREA), have a mandate to increase electricity access nationally. The Sustainable Engineering Lab worked with them to develop a master plan for investment in both on and off-grid electricity systems using GIS-mapping and analysis tools.
