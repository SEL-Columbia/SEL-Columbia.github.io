Changing farming practices based on soil chemistry can dramatically increase productivity. The Soil Doctor project circumvents logistical barriers to adoption (shipping and tracking of soil samples from field to lab, and of results back) by providing a “lab in the box” that visits the farmer. The Sustainable Engineering Lab provides a cell phone app that pairs with the lab to collect information, provide recommendations, and track uptake and impact over time.
