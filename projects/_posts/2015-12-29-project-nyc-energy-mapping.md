summary: "The Modi Research Group's New York City Energy Mapping Project was jointly presented by Professor Vijay Modi and PhD student, Bianca Howard at the NorthEast Clean Heat and Power Initiative conference. The interactive map represents the total annual building energy consumption at the block level and at the taxlot level for New York City, and is expressed in kilowatt hours (kWh) per square meter of land area. The estimate for New York City-specific building energy use was based on a statistical model that utilizes zipcode-level energy consumption data to estimate the average annual energy use for every tax lot — at practically building level — through all five boroughs of the city."
