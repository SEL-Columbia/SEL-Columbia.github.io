<h3>Spatial Planner</h3>
<p>Traditional planning techniques are population-based (eg. X health clinics for Y people). Spatial Planner makes resource planning geography aware: given geographical population distribution and locations of existing infrastructure, this web-based tool recommends where to put new facilities so that the most people are closest to social infrastructure.</p>
