<h3>Humanitarian Data Toolkit</h3>
<p>In humanitarian disasters people affected by the unfolding tragedy need information as much as physical necessities. The Humanitarian Data Toolkit is a ruggedized, self-contained data collection toolkit that makes it possible to conduct rapid mobile and paper based data collection and analysis in an off-line and off-grid environment. The Humanitarian Data Toolkit is a joing project between the Sustainable Engineering Lab and Internews.</p>
