<h3>Development Planning Toolkit</h3>
<p>Processes of evidence-based planning require base layer data about social infrastructure, as well as population, and resource maps. The Development Planning Toolkit is a packaging of the learnings of the Sustainable Engineering Lab into data collection instruments and training packages to enable any group to collect the requisite data for planning tasks such as: electrification, increasing water access, increasing access to maternal health care, improving literacy etc.</p>
