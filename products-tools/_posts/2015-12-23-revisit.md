<h3>Revisit</h3>
<p>Data collection is essential to the development planning process and is a foundation of SEL’s work. Smartphones have made the collection of physical points quick and easy. However, in large, national-scale mapping efforts, it is very difficult to ensure complete coverage in a single collection effort and during multiple efforts to avoid duplication of points. Revisit, currently in development with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, aims to streamline the collection process as well as build a central facility repository that enables countries and organizations to share basic facility data—helping to coordinate aid and maintain a more complete and up-to-date picture of social infrastructure.</p>
