          Delhi Energy Project
        </h3>
        
        <p>
          The Sustainable Engineering Lab is investigating disparities in electricity access and consumption in the capital of India. High resolution electricity load data at the 11-kV feeder level was collected for 2010 &#8211; 2013 from all five electricity distributions companies serving Delhi &#8212; including three private utilities, the New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) and the Military Engineer Services (MES). Clusters of feeders comprising sub-grids were geo-coded and Voronoi polygons were created to approximate the area being serviced by each. These &#8220;grid areas&#8221; (dashed lines) have been overlaid on an administrative map of Delhi and its 9 districts. We are currently looking for population, income, and other socio-economic/demographic data at the district/sub-district level that can then be associated with the weekly electricity consumption data recorded for each grid.

          Liberia Electrification Project
        </h3>
        
        <p>
          Liberia has one of the lowest electrification rates in the world. The country&#8217;s Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy (MLME), power company (LEC), and Rural and Renewable Energy Agency (RREA), have a mandate to increase electricity access nationally. The Sustainable Engineering Lab worked with them to develop a master plan for investment in both on and off-grid electricity systems using GIS-mapping and analysis tools.

          National Electrification Plan: Least-Cost Optimization
        </h3>
        
        <span class="subhead">Myanmar</span> 
        
        <p>
          Amidst the many political and economic changes underway in Myanmar, an important focus of the national development agenda is increased electricity access nationwide. Currently, about 30 percent of the population is connected to the grid, and much of this is concentrated in large urban centers like Yangon and Mandalay, while most rural areas lack access. With support from the World Bank, the Sustainable Engineering Lab is helping to fill a knowledge gap of where and how the utilities, donors, and the private sector can prioritize investments in a combination of grid and off-grid technologies, to address the needs of the country as a whole. SEL is providing methods, tools and trainings in a comprehensive geo-spatial planning approach that uses multiple local data sources, combined with algorithmic processes, to produce a Least-Cost Geospatial Electrification Plan for universal access throughout Myanmar by 2030.

          Nigeria Electricity Access Program
        </h3>
        
        <p>
          Despite abundant domestic energy resources, only around 20 percent of Nigerians have grid electricity, millions rely on electricity from generators, and about 80 million people lack electricity access altogether. In recent years, the country has embarked on an ambitious effort to reform the electricity sector. With funding from the World Bank, utilities seek planning assistance for both rapid expansion of grid networks as well as approaches to increase off-grid access. As a result, SEL began working closely with the domestic utility—KEDCO, which serves Kano, Jigawa, and Katsina states—to create geo-spatially referenced maps of existing electricity infrastructure and subsequently plan for greater access. The work with KEDCO is intended as a pilot, to investigate local datasets and best practices for SEL&#8217;s data-driven approach to be expanded to national scale.

        </h3>
        
        <p>
          Natural gas is a growing share in the global primary energy mix—currently representing 21%—and quickly gaining importance in the developing world. While this resource is already being exploited at relatively large scale in some sub-Saharan countries, the majority is exported outside of the continent with limited domestic use. In recent years, huge offshore natural gas resources have been identified in East Africa (Mozambique and Tanzania). This represents a significant primary energy resource and offers the possibility to support both economic growth and much needed energy access in the region. Natural gas can potentially play an important role in the energy mix for various uses like cooking, power generation, transport and fertilizer manufacture.

          <p>
            Irrigation of crops is critical to agricultural success, but in Senegal, this task is usually done by hand and can take all day. High fuel costs make gasoline pumps unaffordable and initial investment costs of stand-alone solar are too high for small scale farmers. The Sustainable Engineering Lab, as part of <a href="http://www.poweringag.org" target="blank">Powering Agriculture: An Energy Grand Challenge for Development Initiative</a>, is piloting research in the <a href="http://millenniumvillages.org" target="blank">Millennium Village</a> of Potou, to reduce the price of energy for farmers by introducing solar PV as a reliable and cost-effective alternative. The grant is supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) the Swedish Government, Duke Energy, and the German Organization for International Cooperation (GIZ).

SEL worked with the national electric utility (PLN) along with compiling domestic geospatial data sources to map high-need populations and developed a least cost electrification plan including on- and off-grid electrification options.

                    Most rural communities have two options for electrification: wait for the electricity grid, or installing their own home-based systems with high up-front costs. SharedSolar introduces a third: community-based solar grids with smart metering, and mobile phone-based pre-paid credit that allow electricity purchase in small increments.

                    Changing farming practices based on soil chemistry can dramatically increase productivity. The Soil Doctor project circumvents logistical barriers to adoption (shipping and tracking of soil samples from field to lab, and of results back) by providing a “lab in the box” that visits the farmer. The Sustainable Engineering Lab provides a cell phone app that pairs with the lab to collect information, provide recommendations, and track uptake and impact over time.
