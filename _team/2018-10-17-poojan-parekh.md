Poojan is an M.S. student in Mechanical Engineering at Columbia. He has been investigating the energy storage markets and technologies requirements in conjunction with renewable energy resources for a feasible way to reach a 100% renewable globe. He is particularly interested in understanding the grid applications and benefits of power-scaling long duration batteries (whose cost is dominated by charging rate[kW] and not on size[kWh]). Poojan has previously worked with Navigant Consulting as an energy consultant.
