Jonathan Wohl is a multidisciplinary artist and programmer from Madison, WI, currently living and working in New York City. A woodworker by blood and a programmer by trade, his artwork spans the physical and the virtual, exploring the liminal spaces where theory meets practice, rural meets urban, and old meets new. Jonathan has built public APIs for historic financial data, created interactive visualizations of the recent US mortgage crisis, and developed video games using congressional twitter data. With a background in user interface design and an interest in mobile development, Jonathan is excited to be learning a slew of new things here at the Sustainable Engineering Lab. Jonathan holds degrees in time-based art and physics from the University of Wisconsin, and in 2013 participated in the first session of the School for Poetic Computation in New York. He is a founding member of The Notion Collective, a group of collaborating artists working in Brooklyn, NY.
