Shortly after Gordon received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from The University of Toledo, he joined the Peace Corps as a Math and Physics teacher in Rwanda. This experience gave him the travel bug and really opened his eyes to the meaningful opportunities available in developing countries for Engineers. He is currently a pursuing an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Energy Systems. In the lab, he works primarily with the SharedSolar project by developing solutions for issues seen in the field as well as leveraging the data collected since the projectâ€™s inception to show its viability for future installations.
