By applying engineering fundamentals to energy issues from the building scale to large interconnected systems, Dr. Waiteâ€™s research informs pathways to deep energy decarbonization. The focal point of his work is dramatic reductions in building fossil fuel usage, but this links several areas of research and energy system considerations. Through computational models, technology studies, and in-building experimentation, he investigates heating electrification, renewable energy deployment, transmission planning, distributed generation and storage, and building sensors, controls and grid interactivity.  He is also interested in how innovative engineering approaches can serve a just energy transition. He holds a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Columbia University. He is a licensed Professional Engineering, having previously worked as a building technology engineer in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry.
