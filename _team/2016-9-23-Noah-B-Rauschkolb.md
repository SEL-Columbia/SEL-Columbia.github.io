Noah Rauschkolb is an MS/PhD student in the Mechanical Engineering Department researching techniques for making buildings more responsive to variations in wind and solar production. He is currently working in collaboration with the Columbia University Data Science Institute on a DOE-funded project that is using smart-meters to analyze energy consumption patterns in New York City multifamily homes. Before joining the Sustainable Engineering Lab, Noah worked as a building systems engineer at Arup, where he contributed to the designs for a number of district energy and green building projects. He holds a B.A. in Mathematics from Wesleyan University and a B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from Columbia, from which he graduated Magna Cum Laude.
