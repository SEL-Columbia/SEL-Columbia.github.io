A citizen of the world, member of homo sapiens. Graduate of Washington University with degrees in Physics, International Studies and minor in Institutional Social Analysis. Life long tinkerer. This lead me onto the road of programming, and later materialized at Hacker School, a three-month 'unschooling' of everything programming. A combined interest in Technology and Social Ventures eventually lead me to the Sustainable Engineering Lab where I am trying to figure out what we can do to make our world suck less using technology, and at the same time learning about our world.
